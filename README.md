# Update Store Stock Using `with`

In this task, we will be working with a class `StoreService` that manages a store's inventory. The store has three types
of products: shoes, shirts, and jackets. We need to implement a function to update the stock for each product type,
using Kotlin's `with` construct to simplify code readability.

### Task Requirements:

- Implement the method `updateStoreStock` in the `StoreService` class.
- This method should take a `Store` object and additional quantities of shoes, shirts, and jackets to be added to the
  store's stock.
- Use the `with` function to access the store's properties and update the stock for shoes, shirts, and jackets.
